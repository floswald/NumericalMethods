However, every choice of $\\beta$ needs to go together with a corresponding choice of $\\epsilon$'s which need to be chosen s.t. the constraint is satisfied. This is not a general feature of MPEC, as in many cases the parameters of interest would appear in the objective. Also, in a more elaborate model, we would probably have some data that we would want to model to come close to; In that case our objective function would be augmented by the likelihood function of that data together with our model, or we could have a moment criterion etc.\n",
