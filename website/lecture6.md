<h1>Lecture 6: Julia and Data</h1>
~~~

New users are adivsed to start with the [new users section](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/man/basics/#First-Steps-with-DataFrames.jl) in the manual. I advise you to go through that.

In class, instead, we will take the deep dive into the DataFrames.jl package with a showcase.

There is a notebook for you [here](https://github.com/floswald/DataFrames-Showcase)

## Further DataFrames.jl Resources

1. [The Manual](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) is very well done, and lists a bunch of good resources on the landing page.
2. [The ultimate database-ops benchmark](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/)
3. [Bogumi≈Ç's Blog](https://bkamins.github.io/)
4. This tutorial series is _very_ good for the DataFrames.jl package: [https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial](https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial)
5. The [julia academy data science tutorial](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/DataScience) is full of excellent stuff
6. The [Turing Institute's Data Sciences tutorials](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/) give a good intro to data structures and machine learning in julia.
