# Homework 0

The first week's homework is to make you familiar with the Pluto environment. Given it's homework number 0, it won't count towards your grade!

**You can do the homework in teams of max 2 people** (try not to do it alone!)

## You have 3 Tasks

I want you to go through the first 3 Pluto "featured notebooks": "Getting Startet", "Markdown" and "Basic Mathematics". You can see those upon doing

```julia
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```

and scrolling down a bit. 

Once the notebook is loaded, click top right on "edit" this notebook. Complete all tasks.
