# Homework 0

The first week's homework is to make you familiar with the Pluto environment. Given it's homework number 0, it won't count towards your grade!

**You can do the homework in teams of max 2 people** (try not to do it alone!)

## You have 2 Tasks

1. Have some fun with Pluto and mathematics! Start Pluto in your julia session by doing
```julia
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```
    and then click on `open a sample notebook`. Open the *Basic Mathematics* notebook, and complete it.
1. Do a slightly more serious task (still fun 💃🏽👯‍♂️🎉) by [right clicking and saving this notebook.](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework0/hw0.jl)


## Homework Submission

You have one week for this, i.e. submit by next week's class. 

**How and What to Submit?**

* What? Two *static html* files of each of your notebooks (click top right on the triangle and circle symbols)
* How? Upload your `.html` files in format `HW02-name1-name2.html` and `HW03-name1-name2.html` the dropbox file request link which _will be shared with you via slack_.
