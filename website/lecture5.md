<h1>Lecture 5: Optimization 3</h1>
~~~

* Final optimization-only lecture!
* We started with a quick intro to Macros in Julia. Those can modify the users code *before* any computation is performed. You spot them by their `@` prefix (like `@elapsed`).
* We added constraints to our toolbox, and introduced the JuMP.jl framework.
* We talked about the term project deadline (May 21st)
