## Prerequisites: Installing the software environment

Check out the [installation](/installation/) page on this website which was copied from the MIT course *Computational Thinking*.

## Basics: REPL, VSCode, Notebooks

We will repeat the basics of julia in a very condensed manner by going through steps 1-7 of [MoJuWo](https://modernjuliaworkflows.github.io/pages/writing/writing/) live in class.

julia REPL:

VScode:

Notice how there is a julia REPL running _as part of_ the VSCode editor. This is called an _integrated development environment_ (IDE). Very similar to an `R` session connected to `RStudio`, or the `python` interpreter being run through `PyCharm` etc.




## (Rendered) Notebooks

We used several Pluto.jl notebooks in this lecture. Here are four rendered ones:

Please run the [01-fast.jl](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week1/01-fast.jl) notebook on your own computer for the benchmarks! üèéÔ∏è



## Introduction and: Why Julia?

In this section we want to understand why julia is a good choice for computational tasks - for Economists and others.
