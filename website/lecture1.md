## Prerequisites: Installing the software environment

Check out the [installation](/installation/) page on this website which was copied from the MIT course *Computational Thinking*, or just watch the following video to learn how to set up Julia and Pluto -- two pieces of software you will need to run the course materials on your own computer.

## (Rendered) Notebooks

We used several Pluto.jl notebooks in this lecture. Here are three rendered ones:

Topic | Notebook
:-----: | :--------:
Arrays | [click for notebook](../lecture1-arrays)
SIR Model | [click for notebook](../lecture1-SIR)
Data as Images | [click for notebook](../lecture1-images)

Please run the [01-fast.jl](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week1/01-fast.jl) notebook on your own computer for the benchmarks! 🏎️

## Introduction and: Why Julia?

In this section we want to understand why julia is a good choice for computational tasks - for Economists and others.
