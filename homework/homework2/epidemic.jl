# **Homework 2**: _Spatial Epidemic Model_
`ScPoNumericalMethods`, Spring 2021

This homework is based on [Homework 5](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mitmath/18S191/blob/Fall20/homework/homework5/hw5.html) of the MIT course computational thinking. I adapted the questions slightly and added some explanations. 

This notebook contains _built-in, live answer checks_! In some exercises you will see a coloured box, which runs a test case on your code, and provides feedback based on the result. Simply edit the code, run it, and the check runs again.

In this problem set, we will look at a simple **spatial** agent-based epidemic model: agents can interact only with other agents that are *nearby*.  

A simple approach is to use **discrete space**: each agent lives
in one cell of a square grid. For simplicity we will allow no more than
one agent in each cell, but this requires some care to
design the rules of the model to respect this.

Along the way, we will introduce and comment on some julia data types and features that are useful.

In Julia, operations like `+` and `*` are just functions, and they are treated like any other function in the language. The only special property you can use the _infix notation_: you can write

```
instead of 
```julia
+(1, 2)

> #### Extending + in the wild
> Because it is a function, we can add our own methods to it! This feature is super useful in general languages like Julia and Python, because it lets you use familiar syntax (`a + b*c`) on objects that are not necessarily numbers!
> 
> One example is the `RGB` type which defines _colors_ of a pixel for instance. It would define the intensity of `RED`, `GREEN` and `BLUE` of any given pixel. In Julia you are able to do:
> ```julia
> 0.5 * RGB(0.1, 0.7, 0.6)
> ```
> to multiply each color channel by $0.5$. This is possible because `Images.jl` [wrote a method](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorVectorSpace.jl/blob/master/src/ColorVectorSpace.jl#L131):
> ```julia
> *(::Real, ::AbstractRGB)::AbstractRGB
> ```

This an example of *function overloading*, or - more julian - of extending a method to a new type so that we can rely on _multiple dispatch_. Whatever happens when you do `a + b` will depend on what precisly `a` and `b` are. And now we are teaching julia how to do an operation on our new datatype. Cool, right?

👉 Your turn! Implement `addition` on two `Coordinate` structs by adding a method to `Base.:+`. Notice that `Base.` means that function `+` is part of the `Base` module, i.e. core julia. The `:` in front of the `+` makes a _quoted expression_ out of the simple function name `+`. This a way to address the function without calling it.

Possible steps:
- Use `rand(possible_moves, n)` to generate a vector of `n` random moves. Each possible move will be equally likely.
- To compute the trajectory you can use either of the following two approaches:
  1. 🆒 Use the function `accumulate` (see the live docs for `accumulate`). Use `+` as the function passed to `accumulate` and the `w` as the starting value (`init` keyword argument). 
  1. Use a `for` loop calling `+`.

> ### Keyword Arguments and Splatting
>
>In the next cell we define a function to plot a trajectory. Notice how we supply a set of _keyword arguments_ `kwargs` after the semicolon `;` . This will allow us to pass on `Plots.jl`-specific keywords (like `title`, or `xlabs` etc) down to the `plot!` function. 
>
> The splatting operator `...` will insert the elements of `kwargs`, whatever that is (a `Dict` or a `NamedTuple` etc) one by one as keywords in a `key = value` fashion. Read more about this [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/functions/#Keyword-arguments).

Agents live in a box of side length $2L$, centered at the origin. We need to decide (i.e. model) what happens when they reach the walls of the box (boundaries), in other words what kind of **boundary conditions** to use.

One relatively simple boundary condition is a **collision boundary**:

> Each wall of the box is a wall, modelled using "collision": if the walker tries to jump beyond the wall, it ends up at the position inside the box that is closest to the goal.

#### Exercise 3.3

Every time that you move the slider, a completely new simulation is created an run. This makes it hard to view the progress of a single simulation over time. So in this exercise, we we look at a single simulation, and plot the S, I and R curves.

👉 Plot the SIR curves of a single simulation, with the same parameters as in the previous exercise. Use `k_sweep_max = 10000` as the total number of sweeps.

#### Exercise 3.4 (optional)
Let's make our plot come alive! There are two options to make our visualization dynamic:

👉1️⃣ Precompute one simulation run and save its intermediate states using `deepcopy`. You can then write an interactive visualization that shows both the state at time $t$ (using `visualize`) and the history of $S$, $I$ and $R$ from time $0$ up to time $t$. $t$ is controlled by a slider.

👉2️⃣ Use `@gif` from Plots.jl to turn a sequence of plots into an animation. Be careful to skip about 50 sweeps between each animation frame, otherwise the GIF becomes too large.

This an optional exercise, and our solution to 2️⃣ is given below.

## Broadcasting

We mentioned in class that julia can _broadcast_ functions over collections (like vectors). This also works for our own created functions (if it's sufficiently straightforward to know _how_ to map your function over a vector it's automatic, otherwise we need to implement a special `broadcast` method for it). More details [in the manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/#Broadcasting).

You should remember for this exercise that just attaching a dot `.` to the end of your own function will _broadcast_ it over a vector argument! `color.` above clearly does that, but you'll need it somewhere else too!
