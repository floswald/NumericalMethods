# Optimal Time Management

>Florian Oswald, SciencesPo 2021

>First part is based on problem 2.13 of _Approximate Dynamic Programming_ by Warren B. Powell

You suddenly realize towards the end of the semester that your have three courses that have assigned a term project instead of a final exam. You quickly estimate how much each one will take to get the maximum of 100 points. You then guess that if you invest $t$ hours in a project, which you estimated would need $T$ to get 100 points, your score will be

$$R = 100 \sqrt{t/T}$$

In other words, there are declining marginal returns to putting more work into a project.

You decide that you cannot spend morea than a total of 30 hours on those projects, and you want to choose a value of $t$ for each project that is a multiple of 5. Also, you feel you need to spend at least 5 hours on any project (you cannot totally ignore any one project). Here is your estimate of time it takes to get full points:

Project | Completion time $T$ to get 100 points
:--------: | :------------:
1 | 20
2 | 15
3 | 10

You decide to solve the problem as a dynamic program.

# Question 1

* What is the state variable, the choice variable and decision epoch for this problem? Keep in mind that both variables could be vectors.

# Modifying the Setup: True Dynamics

Let's modify the problem slightly. Suppose our table now looks like

Project | Completion time $T$ to get 100 points | Fun Factor Function
:--------: | :------------: | :-----:
1 | 20  | $f(x_1,T_1,\theta_1) = \theta_1(T_1 - x_1)^{3}$
2 | 15  | $f(x_2,T_2,\theta_2) = \theta_2(T_2 - x_2)^{3}$
3 | 10  | $f(x_3,T_3,\theta_3) = \theta_3(T_3 - x_3)^{3}$

So there is now additional element: Different projects are differently _enjoyable_ to work on. Here again $x_i$ is the _time already spent_ on project $i$. _fun_ acrues to the decision maker _while working on the project_. It's the **period payoff**. 

Here is a plot of how _fun_ behaves with time spent on each project. You can see that even though some projects are a lot of fun to work on, all end up with zero fun if you work on them until you reach 100 points. Some projects are so boring that you get negative fun from them. This is a purely artificial example of course üòÑ.

Let's set as default values for $\theta = [0.01,0.01,-0.02]$

# Question 8

* Re-formulate the Bellman Equation. Remember the unit vector definition $e_2 = [0,1,0]$. For our purposes, we move in steps of 5, so let's redefine that as

$$\epsilon_2 \equiv 5 e_2 = [0,5,0]$$ where the index 2 is of course just an example. I propose to , in each period just choose the _index_ of the project to work on, i.e. choose $i \in\{1,2,3\}$. You can then reformulate the law of motion as

$$x(t+1) = x(t) + \epsilon_i$$ which will add 5 to the chosen project's counter.

# Question 9

* solve this on your computer! 
* We are looking for the _policy function_ $i^*(x(t))$ which tells us which project to work on, given state $x(t)$!
* Make a plot that shows the optimal choice of project at each period and the level of associated utility!
